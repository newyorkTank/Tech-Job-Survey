# Tech-Job-Survey

   We want to see how many job ads have the magic tech terms. The terms are grouped into
   several categories, or one giant list. At the end we count the ads for each term.

| Pri   |      Task      |
|----------|-------------|
| 0 |  Store results in mySQL |
| 1 |    Make a React front end for data entry and displaying results  |
| 1 |    place on web-site   |
| 1 |     purge tags from description  |
| 1 |   make output for list_dict_4swords pretty    |
| 1 |   Installation (could it be made executable?)    |
| 2 | Deal with variations of words (SQL, MSSQL, MySQL, NoSQL, Maria = SQL) |
| 3 | Deal with plurals, will make an exception from 4. |     |
| 4 | need to create exclusions i.e. ember but not member, java but not javascript |
| 5 | Decide what to keep from ads, and output that to a file |
| 6 | Create a loop at the bottom that offers user to print detail of one term. |

| 8 |      |
| 8 |  Create mechanism for picking one ad that contains several terms     |

| **C** | and by not counting terms that get repeated in the same ad |
| **C** | Scrap not cut-n-paste |
| **C** |  Make parse4leftovers.py use scrapping, and add more words to search_words |
| **C** | Crawl the web |
| **C** | Capture chunk 25 chars before and after. |
