# Tech Jobs Survey

TJS aims to scrap a popular online classified app to analyze it for particular tech terms, so as to estimate the use of those technologies in the market place.

It also graphically displays the results from past surveys.

A variation is under consideration that will submit custom resumes based on a given criteria.

Some additional ambitions include, building useful libraries for these tasks, and React-based front end.

Currently it is solo project, but as the scope expands and changes I may consider requesting contributions.
